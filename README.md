# Hello developer!

This is a basic webex embedded sample application.  As most "kitchen sink" applications do, it exercises all the events and methods that the framework offers. Be creative! the real magic happens in your own imagination. ü¶Ñ

## What's in this project?

‚Üê `README.md`: That's this file, an intro to what each file is and the details about the project.

‚Üê `style.css`: CSS files add styling rules to your content. We intentionally left things a bit sparse, feel free to expand on the look and feel as you see fit.

‚Üê `index.html`: This is the root page of the site, it also happens to be the "host" configuration page where an app is set up and prepared to be "pushed" (deployed) to the participants!

‚Üê `index.js`: This page contains the javascript which makes the index page do its magic.  Feel free to poke around and see how simply it is to call methods and receive events!

‚Üê `participant.html`: This is the page that is pushed out to a participant, it has similar methods and events as the main page!

‚Üê `participant.js`: This page contains the javascript which feeds the participant experience.  Feel free to poke around and see how simply it is to call methods and receive events!

## Next steps üöÄ

Build an app! You can fork this project or start from scratch. Simply replace the default app url in the emulator with your own app url... super easy!

One final (and important!!) note: This project by default includes a special Mock SDK which is used specifically for the EMULATOR.  If you want your app to work in production simply include the production SDK in place of the emulator SDK.
